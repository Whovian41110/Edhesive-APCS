Also, you should install one of these programs if you haven't already:

* [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
* [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html)
* [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

All of the above IDEs are far superior to the DrJava "IDE" that they encourage you to use.
